# Geo-walker Web-App
**version: second-last**
---
### About
The app tracks your location using geo-coordinates, and towards the end of the trip highlights the path you walked, on the map. You also have the abitlity to view your past activities and map routes, by date. 

### Components used
This is a basic non-persistent Web-app writen in Angular using Ionic Framework.
* Angular
* Ionic framework
* Mapbox 

You'd need your mapbox api_key to make this work.

#### Ok... so what's the point of this app?
This is a cool little niche app for runners and urban explorers to keep track of all the streets they have walked.


### What's next?
No clue. will probably work on making this persistent, or complie it to work as a native mobile app, 
or might just start working on a whole new project in a different human realm.

### Known bugs
* Initially Mapbox doesn't render in full screen. But snaps to fullscreen as soon as an action is done on the window. eg. resizing the browser, opening console screen, etc...
* user coordinates observable is intermittent.
